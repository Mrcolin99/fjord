                    Fjord Pony is an indie rock band whose homebase is Middletown, Connecticut. When they roll up their sleeves and dive into the DIY recording process at their studio clubhouse, it's all about the songwritingâ€”no gimmicks, no tricks. Summoning the ghosts of pop, post-punk, British Invasion, prog rock, alt-country, and the California sound, the band channels their distinct and intersecting influences into a halcyon mashup. Fjord Pony is songwriter Chris Wiedemann (vocals/guitar, left center), Rick Ciervo (keys/guitar, right center), Mike Mongillo (bass guitar, left), and Jesse Alford (drums/percussion, right). And in case you were wondering, no, the name Fjord Pony does not have a satisfying backstory.

                        'Brights On' is an amazing album. Combining the best of modern alt and indie rock while channeling classic rock, Fjord Pony feels like a crossover between Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead." - Rock Era Magazine
